We start doing this prototype for testing only, but now we are looking forward to get this game done (even if it take long time) The game is a platform 2d game, with physics , and puzzles (we love Graphics Adventures and games like Limbo and Machinarium) So, enough talk for the moment, Iâ€™ll post some concepts, videos and ilustrations. I hope you guys like it, and if not I will wait for your critics/comments/suggestions. ",
